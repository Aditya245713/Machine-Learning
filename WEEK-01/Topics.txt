MODULE-1 (Statistics)
    • Mean, median, mode: when each is appropriate
    • Variance and standard deviation as measures of spread
    • Percentiles, quartiles, IQR, and z-score

MODULE-2 (Probability)
    • Events, sample space, and basic probability rules
    • Conditional probability and independence
    • Bayes’ theorem (intuitive and formula-level) and base-rate effects
    • Sensitivity, specificity, false positive/negative rates, PPV, and NPV
    • Class imbalance and its impact on interpreting errors

MODULE-3 (Scaling, Encoding & Distance)
    • Standardization, Min-Max, Robust Scaling
